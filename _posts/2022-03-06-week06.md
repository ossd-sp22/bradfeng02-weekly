### The talk

I enjoyed Christopher Snider's talk. He was really engaged with us, and I thought what he did was interesting as well.<!--more--> I thought it was interesting when he talked about the difference between open and proprietary efforts, when he mentioned how the proprietary guys have to worry about profit margins and other stuff that open efforts dont need to bother with.

I also liked the comparison he made to farmers and their tractors (I hope I'm remembering this right and it wasn't from one of the videos), where instead of not being able to repair their tractors, an open source one would have parts and other resources available to help them repair their stuff themselves.

### Open efforts & the community

One thing I remember him saying was how Dexcom, a proprietary solution, was pushed forward to implement features that open ones were developing. This kind of competition benefits the community by improving all products.

Of course, another benefit to the community is the accessibility of the products from open efforts, which cost less.

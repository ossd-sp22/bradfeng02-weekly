### Installation

Installation was the hardest part of getting into this project. It took me a good part of this weekend to get the development server to run, and there were a lot of challanges.<!--more--> Many of them were little issues with WSL, which is what I was using for the install. But together with my group and a lot of googling, we got it working for all three of us during our weekly meeting.

### The survey

Oppia has a contributor survey we have to fill out. It basically asks for some interests and info about yourself. I filled mine out a week ago, but I'm still waiting for a response. This might be an issue since I'm not sure I can claim issues before then, but hopefully I can.

### Choosing an issue

Oppia has an interesting way of organizing tasks, especially for the 'good first issue' issues. They have one big issue, with a ton of individual tasks. Theses issues have hundred of comments. To claim one, you just comment, tagging the author, asking to claim one or a few of the tasks.

There are also a lot of good first issues to choose from, which is great.

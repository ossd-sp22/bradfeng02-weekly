### Some presentations

One of the presentations I liked most was the Blender one.<!--more--> I liked this one because it kind of tied into our talk/that video about open source in Hollywood. I don't know if any big movies have used Blender over some paid or proprietary software, but it is going to be a more and more viable options as it catches up in features.

Of course, I also enjoyed the Oppia talks. It was really interesting hearing the different perspectives and experiences the other groups had. One that stood out to me was the group (I forgot which) that couldn't get the dev build working, so they instead decided to make some non-code contributions. It was cool that they joined the math meeting, and got to interact with the community that way. This goes to show the scope that projects like Oppia can have; it's more than just code.

### Our progress

We spent some time making our quick presentation. I'm still waiting on someone to answer a questions I have in my pull request. (I'm writing this really late (sorry), but future me is still waiting on this person to respond.)
